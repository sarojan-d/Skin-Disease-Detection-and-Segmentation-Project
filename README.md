# For Skin disease detection and segmentation on ham10000 as major project 
comparison for yolo5 vs yolo7 detection </br>
comparison for u-net and dlabv3+ segmentation </br>
</br>
`prep.ipynb` first try </br>
`prepr.ipynb` 2nd with normalization at 1000 each done but pathing idk what do</br>
</br>

###  multiple file augmentation test went like  `preprocessingmult.ipynb`

`copreprocess3.ipynb` generated preprocessed_images, annotations directoris as follows
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce1f0ba6-41c2-43d2-9243-138d52e8e88e)
but annotations don't match up with either original nor new preprocessed  images
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6860552e-a588-4cb5-96d3-4cfd0b347b65)
and proprocessed ones don't ahve the dimensions at all
